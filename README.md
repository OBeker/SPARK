# SPARK
Code for the ISMRM abstract "Scan-specific, Parameter-free Artifact Reduction in K-space (SPARK)". Reproduces Figure 3.

Notes:
img_grappa_32chan contains the fully sampled coil images, and should be placed in the same folder as SPARK_Fig3.ipynb.
conda_environment.txt lists all the packages in the conda environment that the code was written and tested in, for convenience.
